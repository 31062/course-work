\section{Introduction}
The clients i will be working with are Rob Curtis and Liz Jeffries who work for individual pubs. The company currntly uses selfwriten bespoke software in their pubs, however as good as their software is there are still a few loop holes. the current system manages all stock except for the kitnchen's and manages all retail. the problem with the current system is that its fails to promt the user about certain parts of the stock management system such as to label each item after it's details have been inputed into the system. The system also does not have a privileges 
\subsection{Client Identification}
The clients I will be working with are the landlords of the haymakers pub, Rob Certis and Liz Jeffries, they are looking for a better system to help them better manage their stock. Rob and Liz both work for a company called individual pubs who own five pubs, one in each of Peterborough, Pondon, Porwich and two in Cambridge. individual pubs is a small company in a big industry and already use bespoke software that they have writen themselfs as they can not aford to pay the licensing of profetional software. Because of this it is important that they get to most out of what they can and cannot afford to keep losing stock like they have. Rob have asked and Liz for thier input on the project as they are the ones who use the fast range of functions the software has to provid on a daily basis.
